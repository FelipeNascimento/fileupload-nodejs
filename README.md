As mouthfull as it sounds, but functional it will be, file upload is needed in any application
there for this demo shows how we can upload files directly to our MongoDB using it's GridFS System.

## Dependencies Management :P

In order to use this repository, please feel free to clone directly to your working directory and simply enter this command to your Terminal/CMD :

```
# yarn install
```
or, in case your don't dispose yarn, please use the following command:
```
# npm install
```

## Launching the app :

In case you want to run the app, simply use the following command :

```
# yarn dev
```

This will use the [**ts-node**](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) package so make sure that you've it locally ;) 

## **Updates**:
### **File Upload** : 
I've changed the **upload** endpoints so no in order to upload your documents you will just call for the endpoint bellow :

```
<localhost|server>/v1/bucket/upload
```

### **Checking Uplaoded files** : 
As an added endpoint, now you can view all your uploaded files using this endpoint:

```
<localhost|server>/v1/home
```

This endpoint will give you all uploaded docs within you Database in an array of object that will have the 
following:
```
    [{
        file_name: <uploaded-file-name>,
        file_id: <uploaded-file-id>,
        file_link: <auto-generated-downnload-link>
    }]
```

1. **file_name** : The uploaded file name.
2. **file_id** : An auto generated _if upon file upload over GridFS.
3. **file_link** : An auto generated download link of your file for easy download. 

### **File Download** : 
I've changed the **download** endpoints so no in order to download your documents you will just call for the endpoint bellow :

```
<localhost|server>/v1/bucket/download?document_id=<doc-id>
```

### **Change Log** : 
1. **V1** all supported functionalities.
2. Full re-write in **Typescript**.
3. Code Quality : **Prettier** and **Husky** and **Lint-staged** for formating and re-committing code quality.


Finally, for even more details please check this Youtube tutorial I've created that explains just that.
