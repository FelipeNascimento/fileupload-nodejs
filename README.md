As mouthfull as it sounds, but functional it will be, file upload is needed in any application
there for this demo shows how we can upload files directly to our MongoDB using it's GridFS System.

## **Updates**:
### **File Upload** : 
I've changed the **upload** endpoints so no in order to upload your documents you will just call for the endpoint bellow :

```
<localhost|server>/v1/bucket/upload
```

### **Checking Uplaoded files** : 
As an added endpoint, now you can view all your uploaded files using this endpoint:

```
<localhost|server>/v1/home
```

This endpoint will give you all uploaded docs within you Database in an array of object that will have the 
following:
```
    [{
        file_name: <uploaded-file-name>,
        file_id: <uploaded-file-id>,
        file_link: <auto-generated-downnload-link>
    }]
```

1. **file_name** : The uploaded file name.
2. **file_id** : An auto generated _if upon file upload over GridFS.
3. **file_link** : An auto generated download link of your file for easy download. 

### **File Download** : 
I've changed the **download** endpoints so no in order to download your documents you will just call for the endpoint bellow :

```
<localhost|server>/v1/bucket/download?document_id=<doc-id>
```

### **Change Log** : 
1. **V1** all supported functionalities.
2. Full re-write in **Typescript**.
3. Code Quality : **Prettier** and **Husky** and **Lint-staged** for formating and re-commiting code quality.
